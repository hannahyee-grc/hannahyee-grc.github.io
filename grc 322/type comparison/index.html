        <h1>Baskerville vs. LTC Caslon </h1>
             <h2>History of Each Typeface</h2>

			 <h3>Caslon is a typeface designed and cut by William Caslon in England around 1722. Caslon was a very popular typeface that was even used in the Declaration of Independence. Before William started dedicating his time to fully making type, he engraved gunlocks and barrels. His work became recognized, and he was given the job of cutting type. William's creation of Caslon made English typefaces well known around the world and led to it being used in the American colonies as well. Caslon, being created before Baskerville, was the stepping stone for legible typefaces. The popularity of this typeface was so big that it even replaced Dutch types, which were heavily used at the time.</h3> <!-- Older typeface first, please. -->

			 <h3>Baskerville is a font designed by an English type designer named John Baskerville. Baskerville was designed in the 1757 with the intention of making typefaces easily readable. Baskerville is a transitional typeface, as it tries to break away from the Old Style look while retaining some familiarity. The transition from other typefaces to this one was the contrast in the thin and thick strokes of the letters. Before designing Baskerville, John worked as an entrepreneur of japanned goods, which led him to live a wealthy life as well as being a well-respected individual in Birmingham society. With this, he decided to use his passion for letters and metalwares and decided to open a print shop where he produced and designed type.</h3> <!-- Second typeface here. -->
